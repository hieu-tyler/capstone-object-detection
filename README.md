## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Welcome to object detections and tracking for the Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) model in Capstone Project. Deep learning model from [Jetson Inference library](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference) are used on the Jetson Nano hardware. Also the communication with the desktop and Jetson Nano remotely.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
opencv-python
imutils
numpy
```

#### IMPORTANT 
<b>You should install Jetson package follows by Nvidia before proceed to the next step!! </b>
Download [deep learning model tutorial](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/building-repo-2.md#downloading-models).

Full tutorial [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/realtime-object-detection-in-10-lines-of-python-on-jetson-nano/).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
# If you are using ubuntu, mac or linux
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you are using window
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This should be the output if all your package is installed.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Object detections and tracking

To run the object detections on a video, run this code below.

```
cd object-detection-n-tracking/

python3 main.py `your-video-path` `your-output` 
```
The result should be similiar to this result.

To run the object detections on your webcam, run this code below.

```
cd object-detection-n-tracking/

python3 main.py
```



### Web socket control through Wi-Fi

Run the code below in the following order to run the communication.

```
python3 server.py
```
<img height=300px src="image/terminal-output.jpg" alt="Terminal socket"></a>


Open another terminal, and run the code below.

```
# go the the folder frontend
cd frontend/

python3 main.py
```
<img height=300px src="image/frontend-output.jpg" alt="Frontend"></a>


<b> Notes: </b> Make sure the camera is turn on before proceed the code above.  

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This code will helps you to detect object and track one object at a time. Also, socket programming is used during the communication.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

This code is deployed on Jetson Nano during the Capstone Project by RMIT.
